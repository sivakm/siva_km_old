I am a PhD student at Visual Learning Lab (University of Heidelberg) supervised by Prof. Carsten Rother. I am interested in the general problem of scene understanding through Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 

Currently, I am immensely interested in creating realistically rendered data useful to train deep neural networks. Earlier, I worked on estimating optic flow and disparity in outdoor driving scenes. Also, I had worked on creating extra data through label propagation to improve to improve the performance of semantic segmentation networks.
