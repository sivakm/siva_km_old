I am a PhD student with [Prof. Carsten Rother](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/) at [Visual Learning Lab (University of Heidelberg)](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/) and co-advised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger).<br/>
I focus on developing algorithms and data for self-supervised learning of computer vision tasks.<br/>
I did my Master's at [Robotics Research Center, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) with Prof. K Madhava Krishna, where I worked on object search in indoor environments.
